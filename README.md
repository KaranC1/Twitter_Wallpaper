# Twitter_Wallpaper
Enter in a twitter user's profile name (without the @) and this application will retrieve the most recent image posted and update that to your wallpaper. While this app is running in the background, it will check every 1 hour to see if a new photo has been uploaded and if so, it will change the device's background, through a service.
